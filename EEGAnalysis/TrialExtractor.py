    Extracts trials from array (EEG data + arrow states) into 3d matrix of EEG data per trial for selected channels.
    I.e. We have 10 rows of EEG data + arrow states, 14 channels and arrow state was equal to 2 three times.
    In other words we had three events during this time (user clicked correct arrow 3 times).
    Let's say we want 1 sample before and 1 sample after an event (so that's 3 samples per trial).
    The output will be of size (trials * 3) x (count of channels) x (trials).
    trials[:,:,0] will contain EEG data for first trial
